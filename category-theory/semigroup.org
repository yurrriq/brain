#+alias: semigroups

A semigroup $(S, \cdot)$ consists of:
- a set $S$
- an [[associative]] binary operation $\cdot$

satisfying the following [[axioms]]:
- *Associativity*: $(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$

A semigroup might more systematically be called a semi-monoid, since it's like a
[[monoid]] that might not have an identity element.
