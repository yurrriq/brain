* > This work gives an explanatory introduction to various definitions of
 higher-dimensional category.  The emphasis is on ideas rather than 
formalities; the aim is to shed light on the formalities by emphasising 
the intuitions that lead there.  To aid this, the tone is informal and 
there are copious pictures.  The definitions treated are those of 
Baez-Dolan, Batanin, Joyal, Leinster, May, Penon, Simpson, Street, 
Tamsamani and Trimble.
