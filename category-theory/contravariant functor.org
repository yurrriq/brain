A /*contravariant functor*/ is a [[functor]] with the directions of the [[morphisms]]
reversed, e.g. a /*contravariant functor*/ $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is
a [[functor]] $\mathcal{C}^{op} \to \mathcal{D}$.

A non-contravariant [[functor]] $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is sometimes called a
[[covariant functor]], for emphasis, and to disambiguate from the /*contravariant
functor*/ $\mathcal{C}^{op} \to \mathcal{D}$.
